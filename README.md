Explanation
1.	Environment Setup:
   
o	environment_setup.sh sets up the necessary environment by installing Java, Apache Spark, Miniconda, and required Python packages including pyspark, torch, and torchvision.
3.	Data Ingestion and Preprocessing with Apache Spark:

o	data_ingestion_preprocessing.py demonstrates reading a large dataset from HDFS, preprocessing the data using Spark DataFrame operations, and writing the processed data back to HDFS in Parquet format.
4.	Distributed Machine Learning with PyTorch on Apache Spark:

o	distributed_ml.py demonstrates building a machine learning pipeline with Spark's MLlib for feature extraction and using PyTorch for model training. The data is read from HDFS, preprocessed using Spark MLlib, and converted to PyTorch tensors for training a neural network model.
