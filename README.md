Distributed Data Processing and Machine Learning Pipeline
This project demonstrates the use of Apache Spark and PyTorch for handling large-scale data, performing advanced computations, and leveraging open-source tools in a Linux-based environment. The goal is to build an end-to-end distributed data processing and machine learning pipeline.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
A Linux-based environment
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) configured and running
Basic knowledge of Linux command line and shell scripting
Environment Setup
To set up the environment, run the environment_setup.sh script:

bash
Copy code
bash environment_setup.sh
This script will:

Install Java (required for Apache Spark)
Download and install Apache Spark
Install Miniconda and create a Python environment with the necessary packages (pyspark, torch, torchvision)
Usage
Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
To ingest and preprocess the data, run the data_ingestion_preprocessing.py script:

bash
Copy code
python data_ingestion_preprocessing.py
This script will:

Read a large dataset from HDFS
Preprocess the data (e.g., convert labels)
Save the processed data back to HDFS in Parquet format
Distributed Machine Learning
To perform distributed machine learning, run the distributed_ml.py script:

bash
Copy code
python distributed_ml.py
This script will:

Read the preprocessed data from HDFS
Use Spark's MLlib to extract features
Train a neural network model using PyTorch
Pipeline Description
Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
Read Data: Load a large dataset from HDFS.
Preprocess Data: Clean and transform the data, including label conversion.
Save Processed Data: Write the processed data back to HDFS in Parquet format.
Distributed Machine Learning
Read Processed Data: Load the processed data from HDFS.
Feature Extraction: Use Spark's MLlib to tokenize, hash, and apply TF-IDF to the text data.
Train Model: Convert the features to PyTorch tensors and train a neural network model.
Results
The results of the training process, including model performance metrics, will be printed to the console during training. You can modify the scripts to save these results to a file for further analysis.
